'''
Make list of size k, initialize all entries to 0, 0.
First entry in the tuple will be the distance, second entry will be the label
Fill up the array with the first k points
For all successive points, calculate smallest distance and replace the point in
the array that is farthest from the test point only if the new distance is smaller
